Here we introduce a new class of learnable models–based on graph networks–which implement an inductive bias for object- and relation-centric representations of complex, dynamical systems. Our results show that as a forward model, our approach supports accurate predictions from real and simulated data, and surprisingly strong and efficient generalization, across eight distinct physical systems which we varied parametrically and structurally. We also found that our inference model can perform system identification. Our models are also differentiable, and support online planning via gradient-based trajectory optimization, as well as offline policy optimization. Our framework offers new opportunities for harnessing and exploiting rich knowledge about the world, and takes a key step toward building machines with more human-like representations of the world.} }

Previous works have devised robust methods for handling collisions in elastic bodies, cloth, or fiber assemblies such as hair, but the performance of many of those algorithms degrades when applied to objects with different topologies or constitutive models, or simply cannot scale to high-enough numbers of contacting points.In this work we propose a unified approach, able to handle a large class of dynamical objects, that can solve for millions of contacts with unbiased Coulomb friction while keeping computation time and memory usage reasonable. Our method allows seamless coupling between the various simulated components that comprise virtual characters and their environment. Furthermore, our proposed approach is simple to implement and can be easily integrated in popular time integrators such as Projected Newton or ADMM.},

abstract = {Many underlying relationships among data in several areas of science and engineering, e.g., computer vision, molecular chemistry, molecular biology, pattern recognition, and data mining, can be represented in terms of graphs. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function τ(G, n) ∈IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.},

abstract = {Humans have a remarkable capacity to understand the physical dynamics of objects in their environment, flexibly capturing complex structures and interactions at multiple levels of detail. Inspired by this ability, we propose a hierarchical particle-based object representation that covers a wide variety of types of three-dimensional objects, including both arbitrary rigid geometrical shapes and deformable materials. We then describe the Hierarchical Relation Network (HRN), an end-to-end differentiable neural network based on hierarchical graph convolution, that learns to predict physical dynamics in this representation. Compared to other neural network baselines, the HRN accurately handles complex collisions and nonrigid deformations, generating plausible dynamics predictions at long time scales in novel settings, and scaling to large scene configurations. These results demonstrate an architecture with the potential to form the basis of next-generation physics predictors for use in computer vision, robotics, and quantitative cognitive science.},

abstract = {Typical design for manufacturing applications requires simultaneous optimization of conflicting performance objectives: Design variations that improve one performance metric may decrease another performance metric. In these scenarios, there is no unique optimal design but rather a set of designs that are optimal for different trade-offs (called Pareto-optimal). In this work, we propose a novel approach to discover the Pareto front, allowing designers to navigate the landscape of compromises efficiently. Our approach is based on a first-order approximation of the Pareto front, which allows entire neighborhoods rather than individual points on the Pareto front to be captured. In addition to allowing for efficient discovery of the Pareto front and the corresponding mapping to the design space, this approach allows us to represent the entire trade-off manifold as a small collection of patches that comprise a high-quality and piecewise-smooth approximation. We illustrate how this technique can be used for navigating performance trade-offs in computer-aided design (CAD) models.},

abstract = {We demonstrate an interactive method to create heterogeneous continuous deformable materials on complex three-dimensional meshes. The user specifies displacements and internal elastic forces at a chosen set of mesh vertices. Our system then rapidly solves an optimization problem to compute a corresponding heterogeneous spatial distribution of material properties using the Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis. We apply our method to linear and nonlinear isotropic deformable materials. We demonstrate that solving the problem interactively in the full-dimensional space of individual tetrahedron material values is not practical. Instead, we propose a new model reduction method that projects the material space to a low-dimensional space of material modes. Our model reduction accelerates optimization by two orders of magnitude and makes the convergence much more robust, making it possible to interactively design material distributions on complex meshes. We apply our method to precise control of contact forces and control of pressure over large contact areas between rigid and deformable objects for ergonomics. Our tetrahedron-based dithering method can efficiently convert continuous material distributions into discrete ones and we demonstrate its precision via FEM simulation. We physically display our distributions using haptics, as well as demonstrate how haptics can aid in the material design. The produced heterogeneous material distributions can also be used in computer animation applications.},

abstract="Natural Language Processing (NLP) in combination with Machine Learning techniques plays an important role in the field of automatic text analysis. Motivated by the successful use of NLP in solving text classification problems in the area of e-Participation and inspired by our prior work in the field of polymorphic shellcode detection we gave classical NLP-processes a trial in the special case of malicious code analysis. Any malicious program is based on some kind of machine language, ranging from manually crafted assembler code that exploits a buffer overflow to high level languages such as Javascript used in web-based attacks. We argue that well known NLP analysis processes can be modified and applied to the malware analysis domain. Similar to the NLP process we call this process Machine Language Processing (MLP). In this paper, we use our e-Participation analysis architecture, extract the various NLP techniques and adopt them for the malware analysis process. As proof-of-concept we apply the adopted framework to malicious code examples from Metasploit.",

abstract = {The problem of cross-platform binary code similarity detection aims at detecting whether two binary functions coming from different platforms are similar or not. It has many security applications, including plagiarism detection, malware detection, vulnerability search, etc. Existing approaches rely on approximate graph-matching algorithms, which are inevitably slow and sometimes inaccurate, and hard to adapt to a new task. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to compute the embedding, i.e., a numeric vector, based on the control flow graph of each binary function, then the similarity detection can be done efficiently by measuring the distance between the embeddings for two functions. We implement a prototype called Gemini. Our extensive evaluation shows that Gemini outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by large margins with respect to similarity detection accuracy. Further, Gemini can speed up prior art's embedding generation time by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude and reduce the required training time from more than 1 week down to 30 minutes to 10 hours. Our real world case studies demonstrate that Gemini can identify significantly more vulnerable firmware images than the state-of-the-art, i.e., Genius. Our research showcases a successful application of deep learning on computer security problems.},
